 *         Hash Collision
 * 
 *         Hashing Mechanism
 * 
 *         Linked Hash Map[ doubly linked list]
 * 
 *         WeakedHashMap
 * 
 *         TreeMap
 * 
 *         How TreeSet implemented internally [Dummy value to associate with an Object in the backing Map => {Object PRESENT} ]
 * 
 *         Sort by value using comparator
 * 
 *         Sorted Map without TreeMap
 * 
 *         Identity Hash Map ... (r1==r2 rather than r1.equals(r2))
 * 
 *         ConcurrentHashMap
 * 
 *         ConcurrentSkipListMap is equivalent of TreeMap (concurrent version)
 * 
 *         Concurrent Modification Exception
 * 
 *         Fail Fast / Fail safe
 * 
 *         No Duplicate in ArrayList
